# TheCloud.lv2

The Cloud is a particle delay plugin for Mod devices (only tested on a Dwarf).
It creates a shifting cloud of echoes which fly into hearing range and out again.
You can control how long the echo particles last, how spread out they are in time and where they are in stereo space.
You can also affect how much the pitches of the echoes deviate within the cloud.

The Cloud was created with Pd (Pure Data) and exported to hvcc using PlugData.
